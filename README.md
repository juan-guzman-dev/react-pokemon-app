# Pokemon App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

***Pokegame*** takes a list of 8 pokemon and randomly assign them into two hands of 4 cards each. It then renders two ***Pokedex*** components, one for each hand.  

***Pokegame*** also calculates the total experience for each hand of pokemon. It passes this total to the ***Pokedex***.  
Next, the ***Pokegame*** component determines which hand is the “winner,” where the winning hand is the one with the higher total experience. If the ***Pokedex*** is the winning one, it displays the message “THIS HAND WINS!” at the top of the deck.  

Now when you load the page, you should see two different hands with a randomly changing winner every time you refresh.
